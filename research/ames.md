[Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com) (GEE) is a web-platform that I use to gather satellite imagery for my research projects. GEE can help me quickly display images from the LANDSAT satellite to visualize the change in land cover over the last 3 decades. Press the play button in the embedded GEE window above to watch a timelapse of LANDSAT imagery taken of Ames, Iowa. Watch as the Northwest and Southwest corners of Ames are developed over the years.
