Data Management
==========

As part of the DataFEWSion Traineeship Program, I gave [this presentation](https://rpubs.com/clabuzze/datamanagement) to my fellow trainees. The presentation is based on my suggestions for managing personal, academic, and research data on your computer. I have learned these tips and tricks from my experience as a graduate student in the Department of Statistics, especially from Dr. Niemi. Along with file management, I introduce how to store research data in an R project and provide links to learning more about R Package and R Data Package development. R Data Packages are especially convenient in supporting open and reproducible research.
