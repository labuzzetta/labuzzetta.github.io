FEWS (Food, Energy, Water Systems) Course Syllabus
==========

While the 'FEWS Nexus' has existed as a buzzword for several decades, it has gained a great deal of attention in recent years. In my experience, courses designed to teach about the FEWS Nexus as a field of research are severely underdeveloped. It seems that 'FEWS' is sometimes used as a catch-all for any research that falls into studying any food, energy, or water topic whether or not the work addresses the complex tradeoffs that exist between these sectors. In my opinion, true FEWS Nexus research must assess these tradeoffs and also consider the social, economic, and/or political perspectives that may influence their interactions. In order to better form FEWS Nexus researchers, I developed a syllabus to (hypothetically) train students in this area of research. This course has not been implemented outside of this syllabus, but I hope that someday it may be of use to either myself or others in fully implementing a course on the FEWS Nexus.

### FEWS 690: Introduction to the FEWS Nexus

**Course Description**
This course is designed to provide an introduction to the Food, Energy, Water Systems (FEWS) nexus. Students will learn to understand the FEWS nexus as a modeling framework for analyzing the complex tradeoffs between food, energy, and water at multiple spatial and temporal scales in order to develop policies that better address the needs of many stakeholders. The FEWS nexus is a broad field of research, centered in sustainability and environmental science but strongly influenced by agronomy, ecology, engineering, natural resources management, political science, sociology, and statistics. Key theories and perspectives from these disciplines will be introduced to help us think about the complex nature of the FEWS nexus. This course will build a foundation for approaching such research in the context of the agricultural Midwest United States.

**Learning outcomes**
1. Describe the FEWS nexus as a framework for sustainability research.
2. Explain relevant social and political perspectives in the context of the FEWS nexus.
3. Identify key modeling approaches in FEWS nexus research.
4. Identify contemporary sustainability challenges and critically assess the FEWS nexus as a framework for addressing tradeoffs amongst many stakeholders.
5. Effectively communicate and apply FEWS nexus approaches to understanding sustainability in the agricultural Midwest.

**Assignments and Evaluation**
The course is designed primarily to promote discussion amongst students and build community through critical thinking. Additionally, a final project helps to integrate the FEWS nexus into each student's individual research.

1. Class Attendance and Participation (20%)
This course is discussion-based and therefore it is very important to come to class prepared to engage in the discussions. Each week there will be one or two assigned readings that will be discussed during the class. Students are expected to engage in the discussions at the graduate level. When participating in class discussions, sharing facts, thoughts, opinions and questions that seek to further the conversation rather than sideline it is important. See the attendance and participation rubric for further details on assessment.

2. Discussion Questions (30%)
Before each class, students are required to post at least one question per reading on the Canvas discussion board. These questions will be used to promote discussion in class. Relevant context for each question should be provided so that everyone can understand the thought process behind the question and why it is important. Therefore, a short paragraph ending in a question should be submitted for each reading. The teacher will review these questions prior/during class and use them to facilitate the discussion if it is not developing organically. See the discussion rubric for further details on assessment.

3. Readings Introduction (5 + 5 = 10%)
Each student will summarize and present two readings to the class over the semester. All students will present their first reading in the third week of class. These readings will be chosen by students based on interest from a subset of references in Newell et al. (2019). For this presentation each student will have 6 - 8 minutes to summarize their reading. Providing a digital powerpoint handout for each presentation will be required. Additionally, students will sign up for one additional set of weekly readings to summarize in the 5th - 14th weeks of class. The assigned student will take 6 - 8 minutes at the beginning of class to present their reading(s) and also provide a powerpoint handout to all other students and the teacher. See the reading introduction rubric for further details on assessment.

4. Final Paper (30%)
The final paper is meant to be a targeted and tangible outcome of this class to help each student apply and incorporate the FEWS nexus into their research. Students will be expected to write a literature review, project proposal, or research paper of approximately 5,000 words on a topic related to the FEWS nexus. Students may choose the format of the project that best aligns with their current stage of research and thesis/dissertation completion. See the final paper rubric for further details on assessment.

5. Final Presentation (10%)
A formal presentation of the final paper to the class will be required. See the final presentation rubric for further details on assessment.
